## Imo Schools Project

 This is a website that brings private (and few prominent public schools) together in a
 comparative mode such that Parents (or Guidance) can visit the site and select 
  the school most suitable for their kids.

## Benefits  
 This Comparism will push schools to improve on their services, 
  resulting in Quality education in Imo State. The site will also run 
  some free services that will attract students and the citizens to the site.
